<!-- By rob at archetyp.al

Inspired by the one dimensional cellular-automata explored by
Stephen Wolfram in "A New Kind of Science".

There are many implementations of the one dimensional CA, but
this particular project is meant to allow the user to explore the
properties of the various rules by starting from initial conditions
other than a single "on" cell in the center.

This version still begins with the typical single "on" cell in the
center at the first time-step or after a reset (r). However, the user
can change the rule at any step, causing the output of the previous
rule to be the input of the next rule. This leads to discoveries and
an enjoyable interaction with the system and sense for how it works
that does not come from merely reading about it or watching a single
rule play out.  -->
